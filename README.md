# FoodTruckProject

#Overview
Hello and Welcome to my Food Truck Project! Here I have a command line program that randomly generates unique ID's for Food Trucks after they submit their truck's information. 

As well as looping a menu for the customers to retrieve the input information from the truck owners!
